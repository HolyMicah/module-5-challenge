# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Used bootsrap and Jquery elements to create an interactive schedule. Used bootstrap to structure the page and used jquery and JavaScript in order to add functionallity. Used on click functions to facillitate class changes and to store and present saved data on page refresh. Also used moment.js in order to allow time functionality and tracking. 

I had to be away from my PC for this project and was not able to do pushes to update my files so I had to just upload directly to my repo. Prior to that I made multiple pushes with comments.
